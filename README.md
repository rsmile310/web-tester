## INSTRUCTIONS
1. I will provide you a basic website that already has its HTML and CSS built.
2. You need to use the next structures at least once: if else, for, while, arrays.
3. Use JQUERY to display information on the website according to the season in which the user is viewing the page (this one is shared with another classmate so you don't have to do everything, it depends on how much work he sends to me).
4. Use AJAX to fetch information from a JSON file, using it, for example, to list different items with their price and availability (this is the most important part).

### Items
I'm attaching a list of items (and their prices) that the brand will "sell" besides the services already listed on the website, so you can use them to work on point #4.
